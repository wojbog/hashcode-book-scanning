Each year, **Google** contributes to the competitve programming world with Hash Code. The goal of this team competition is to solve an **optimization problem statment** in or under four hours time. Teams can be of 2 to 4 people. The competition have been attracting top competive programming talents and enthusiasts all around the globe.

This year, had been my **first** contribution to the competition and I have teamed out with my friend **[Ahmed Morsy](https://github.com/AhmedMorsy95)**. And since we are in senior year , what a better possible name for a team than **JustLetMeGraduate**.

## This Year's Problem: BookScanning 
The full details of the Problem is available in [Official Problem Statment by Google](./BookScanningProblem.pdf). I really recommend to give it a read and start coding you way through your own implementation if you haven't partipated in the competition already. It's really worth every bit of your time !
